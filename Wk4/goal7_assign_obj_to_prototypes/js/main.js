/*First I need to create a list of names. They should be in an Array
    Create three instances of the Person object using a FOR loop and place each reference of the object in an array called people.
    When instantiating the Person object, make sure a randomly chosen name (using the Math.random() method)
    from the names array is sent to the constructor of the person along with
    what row number in the HTML the information will be displayed in.*/
